title: Labeling
---

This page is to explain the conventions over Parity's labeling system.

Labels are split into several groups.

- 'A' group is used for code-review status and are applicable only to Pull Requests.
- 'B' group is used for pull requests for upcoming beta releases.
- 'F' group is used to encode the type (and accordingly the severity) of issues; they are applicable only within the Issue Tracker.
- 'M' group is to encode the affected component or sub-project.
- 'P' group is to denote priority. They are generally relevant only to issues, though may in principle be used on pull-requests.
- 'Q' group is to denote difficulty.
- 'Z' group are reasons for why something is a non-issue. They are applicable only within the Issue Tracker.

As such, a pull request must have a single label from the 'A' group and may additionally have a single label from the 'P' group (though typically will not).

An valid issue must have a single label from the 'F' group and may additionally have a single label from the 'P' group. An invalid issue should be closed with a single label from the 'Z' group.

### 'A' group

All pull requests should start labeled with either 'A0-pleasereview', 'A3-inprogress', 'A8-backport' (in the base of an already-reviewed back-port), or 'A2-insubstantial' (should it be an alteration which requires no code review). After review it should be relabeled with another 'A' group label.

- ![A0-pleasereview](http://i.imgur.com/8lr1M4r.png) Pull request needs code review.
- ![A1-onice](http://i.imgur.com/xZ9YJvB.png) Pull request is reviewed well, but should not yet be merged.
- ![A2-insubstantial](http://i.imgur.com/xPahkpz.png) Pull request requires no code review (e.g. a sub-repository hash update).
- ![A3-inprogress](http://i.imgur.com/rQbszDc.png) Pull request is in progress. No review needed at this stage.
- `A3-stale` Pull request did not receive any updates in a long time. No review needed at this stage and should be closed if author does not indicate any further work is done.
- `A4-awaitingci` Pull request is waiting for changes on the CI to complete tests before review/merge can begin.
- ![A4-clasignoffneeded](http://i.imgur.com/QSNNtk0.png) Pull request requires author to sign off on CLA before review/merge can begin.
- ![A4-gotissues](http://i.imgur.com/fUyJ8PO.png) Pull request is reviewed and has significant issues which must be addressed. Once addressed, author should relabel as `A0-pleasereview`.
- ![A5-grumble](http://i.imgur.com/fD1vO9N.png) Pull request has minor issues that must be addressed before merging. This may require only replying to comments. Pull request should be relabeled as `A0-pleasereview` to get a final sign-off from a reviewer.
- ![A6-mustntgrumble](http://i.imgur.com/hGDrT93.png) Pull request has areas for improvement. The author need not address them before merging.
- ![A6-revert](http://i.imgur.com/0EILx22.png) Pull request that reverts recent changes.
- ![A7-looksgoodcantmerge](http://i.imgur.com/3yYImuZ.png) Pull request is reviewed well, but cannot be merged due to conflicts.
- ![A7-looksgoodtestsfail](http://i.imgur.com/4APg6fE.png) Pull request is reviewed well, but cannot be merged due to tests failing.
- ![A8-backport](http://i.imgur.com/VnFVyWk.png) Pull request is already reviewed well in another branch.
- ![A8-looksgood](http://i.imgur.com/XfRlSzA.png) Pull request is reviewed well.
- ![A9-buythatmanabeer](http://i.imgur.com/MycyedU.png) Pull request is reviewed well and worth buying the author a beer.
- ![A9-FUCKYEAH!](http://i.imgur.com/HZQeL2M.png) Pull request is reviewed well and can not be compensated with any amount of beer in the galaxy ;)

### 'B' group

Used on pull requests only. Denotes tasks for the next beta release.

- ![B0-patch](http://i.imgur.com/WVij4kk.png) Pull request should also be back-ported to the beta branch.
- ![B1-relnotes](http://i.imgur.com/eFiTrqa.png) Changes should be mentioned in the release notes of the next major version.

### 'F' group

Issues should have only one of these. Do not combine; if multiple labels are equally applicable to an issue, use the one with the lowest number.

- ![F0-consensus](http://i.imgur.com/IiVrLJn.png)  Issue can lead to a consensus failure.
- ![F1-panic](http://i.imgur.com/PvDKeCe.png) The client panics and exits without proper error handling.
- ![F1-security](http://i.imgur.com/0PrqmGX.png) The client fails to follow expected, security-sensitive, behaviour.
- ![F2-bug](http://i.imgur.com/EJhD1MQ.png) The client fails to follow expected behavior.
- ![F3-annoyance](http://i.imgur.com/Zsd8zxB.png) The client behaves within expectations, however this "expected behaviour" itself is at issue. Annoyances are small enhancements which dramatically improve the usability of the client.
- ![F4-tests](http://i.imgur.com/jFiH84M.png) Tests need fixing, improving or augmenting.
- ![F5-documentation](http://i.imgur.com/iYgnzcd.png) Documentation needs fixing, improving or augmenting.
- ![F6-refactor](http://i.imgur.com/HCloAwV.png) Code needs refactoring.
- ![F7-footprint](http://i.imgur.com/lE1ESzo.png) An enhancement to provide a smaller (system load, memory, network or disk) footprint.
- ![F7-optimisation](http://i.imgur.com/DNym8en.png) An enhancement to provide better overall performance in terms of time-to-completion for a task.
- ![F8-enhancement](http://i.imgur.com/ziRfEiW.png) An additional feature.
- `F9-meta` A specific issue for grouping tasks or bugs of a specific category.
- ![F9-release](http://i.imgur.com/zl4BiqW.png) A specific release. All such issues should be templated on [1387](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/1387).

### 'M' group

Used to denote the affected component or sub-project. Each issue and pull request should have (at least) one.

### 'P' group

Typically used only to annotate issues, however P0 and P2 may reasonably be used on PRs in exceptional circumstances.

- ![P0-dropeverything](http://i.imgur.com/GW63MgN.png) Everyone should address the issue/PR now.
- ![P2-asap](http://i.imgur.com/Lqi1wHj.png) No need to stop dead in your tracks, however issue/PR should be addressed as soon as possible.
- ![P5-sometimesoon](http://i.imgur.com/HI0gW9B.png) Issue is worth doing soon.
- ![P7-nicetohave](http://i.imgur.com/WlcjjSv.png) Issue is worth doing eventually.
- ![P9-somedaymaybe](http://i.imgur.com/r9qQFId.png) Issue might be worth doing eventually.

### 'Q' group

Is used to annotate difficulty of issues.

- ![Q0-trivial](http://i.imgur.com/K8BWrSm.png) Can be fixed by anyone with access to a computer.
- `Q1-mentor` An easy task were a mentor is available. Please indicate in the issue who the mentor could be.

- ![Q9-epic](http://i.imgur.com/Q3mBYJy.png) Can only be fixed by John Skeet.

### 'Z' group

Used only on issues which will (or _may_, in the case of Z5) be closed immediately.

- ![Z0-duplicate](http://i.imgur.com/SBxVhGd.png) Issue is a duplicate. Closer should comment with a link to the duplicate.
- ![Z0-intended](http://i.imgur.com/qbfIlvR.png) Issue describes a behavior which turns out to work as intended. Closer should explain why.
- ![Z0-invalid](http://i.imgur.com/dOX7QyV.png) Issue is invalid. Closer should comment why.
- ![Z0-question](http://i.imgur.com/EN3xLJn.png) Issue is a question. Closer should answer.
- ![Z0-stale](http://i.imgur.com/Ds2ZUIl.png) Issue is in principle valid, but it is not relevant anymore or can not reproduced.
- ![Z0-wontfix](http://i.imgur.com/pPJTV2h.png) Issue is in principle valid, but this project will not address it. Closer should explain why.
- ![Z5-unconfirmed](http://i.imgur.com/X747d5L.png) Issue might be valid, but it's not yet known.
